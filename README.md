# Small Module For Statistics
It is a tiny statistic module that contains some basic functions. It took 90 minutes from my life.

You can create Frequency and Stem-Leaf diagrams with this.

You are free to use and modify.

I wrote this because i needed to use Minitab in my Statistics class but Minitab has not a Linux version and it is not Free Software.

# How can you use it?

It is pure python3 and does not have a User Interface. You need to run it on Terminal or Command Line. 

- Open a terminal and write "python3 probability.py"

- Enter the name of CSV file that only contains your data as integers or floats. Otherwise it will not work :)

- Your file's name must be in the form of "example.csv". Do not forget the .csv part.

- It only works with CSV file type.
